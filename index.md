### Websites I've Created
I've been tinkering with creating shitty websites since middle school,
here's a listing of the ones that are still up, and I'm not too embarrassed to show:

* [Skyborne.net](https://skyborne.net)
* [GoICC](https://goicc.skyborne.net)
* [Current portfolio](https://colermanning.com). A bit outdated
* [Ooooold project site](https://lugubrious.rip). This web host actually lost all the content I had hosted here (circa. early 2021), citing a "glitch in our backup system, due to some legacy modifications in cPanel and your account was not included in our backups"
